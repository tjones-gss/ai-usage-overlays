# AI Usage Overlay

Always-on-top Windows HUD for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor IDE usage in one tray app.

![Unified overlay preview](docs/preview.png)

## What It Shows

**Claude Code**
- Live 5-hour session and weekly quota usage
- Optional Fable and Opus weekly quota rows when Anthropic returns them
- Extra usage / overage spend when enabled
- Local transcript totals: estimated API-equivalent value, tokens, sessions, and messages

**Codex**
- Local session tokens from `~\.codex\sessions`
- Estimated API-equivalent value
- Session and message counts
- Today's tokens and messages
- 5-hour and weekly Codex rate-limit percentages when present in session logs

**Cursor IDE**
- On-demand spend
- Included request usage with OVER detection
- 30-day agent edits, today's edits, accepted lines, and top model

## Install

**Recommended** - download `AIUsageOverlaySetup.exe` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/tjones-gss/ai-usage-overlays/releases/latest), then run it.

The setup app installs AI Usage Overlay for your Windows user, adds Start Menu entries, creates the login startup shortcut, and launches the overlay automatically. No git, no Python, and no admin rights are required.

**PowerShell fallback** - if you cannot use the setup EXE, paste this into PowerShell, or hand it to your Claude / Cursor agent:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjones-gss/ai-usage-overlays/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

This downloads the repo zip, installs the same script app under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIUsageOverlay`, and launches the unified overlay automatically.

**Let your AI agent do it** - paste this into Claude Code or Cursor chat:
> Run this in PowerShell to install the AI usage overlay: `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjones-gss/ai-usage-overlays/master/install.ps1 | iex`

**Manual developer install** - clone the repo and run `Install.bat`. Login autostart uses `Start-Unified.vbs`.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
- Claude Code CLI signed in (`claude auth login`)
- Codex installed if you want Codex stats; sessions are read from `~\.codex\sessions`
- Cursor IDE signed in if you want Cursor usage and analytics

Each provider is optional. If one source is unavailable, the overlay keeps showing the other sections.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Show / hide overlay | Left-click the **AI** tray icon |
| Show / hide Claude, Codex, or Cursor section | Right-click -> Show/Hide provider |
| Expand / collapse a section | Click its section header |
| Refresh usage immediately | Right-click -> Refresh now |
| Print one JSON snapshot | `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json` |
| Print only one provider | `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json -Provider Codex` |
| Copy current stats | Right-click -> Copy stats to clipboard |
| Open Claude usage page | Right-click -> Open claude.ai/usage |
| Change theme or opacity | Right-click -> Theme / Opacity |
| Snap to a screen corner | Right-click -> Snap to corner |
| Start at login | Right-click -> Open at login |
| Start hidden | Right-click -> Start hidden to tray |
| Toggle alerts or graph | Right-click -> Threshold alerts / Show history graph |
| Check for app updates | Right-click -> Check for updates |
| Quit | Right-click -> Quit |

The overlay saves its position, opacity, theme, start-hidden setting, graph/alert preferences, and visible provider sections.

### JSON Snapshot Schema

`unified-overlay.ps1 -Json` prints one machine-readable snapshot and exits before any WPF HUD startup. The output contract is versioned with `schema: "ai-usage.snapshot.v1"` and all provider data lives under a normalized `providers` envelope:

```json
{
  "schema": "ai-usage.snapshot.v1",
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-09T12:34:56.0000000-05:00",
  "appVersion": "0.2.2",
  "request": {
    "providers": ["claude", "codex", "cursor"],
    "timeoutSec": {
      "claude": 20,
      "cursor": 20
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "claude": {
      "selected": true,
      "status": "ok",
      "message": "",
      "lastFetch": "12:34",
      "identity": null,
      "usage": {},
      "stats": {},
      "error": null,
      "statsError": null
    },
    "codex": {
      "selected": true,
      "status": "unavailable",
      "stats": null,
      "error": null
    },
    "cursor": {
      "selected": true,
      "status": "unavailable",
      "message": "Cannot read Cursor token from state.vscdb",
      "lastFetch": "",
      "usage": null,
      "summary": null,
      "local": null,
      "error": null
    }
  }
}
```

Provider status is data, not the process result. Missing or unavailable providers are represented in JSON and do not make snapshot mode fail; providers excluded by a filter are still present with `selected: false` and `status: "skipped"`.

Provider and timeout controls:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json -Provider Claude,Codex
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json -ClaudeOnly
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json -CursorOnly -TimeoutSec 5
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\unified-overlay.ps1 -Json -ClaudeTimeoutSec 3 -CursorTimeoutSec 8
```

`-Provider` accepts `Claude`, `Codex`, and `Cursor`. The `-ClaudeOnly`, `-CodexOnly`, and `-CursorOnly` switches are shortcuts; if any are supplied, they define the selected provider set. `-TimeoutSec` sets the default network timeout for Claude and Cursor. `-ClaudeTimeoutSec` and `-CursorTimeoutSec` override that default for their provider. Timeout values are clamped to 1-120 seconds.

## Uninstall

Use Windows **Settings -> Apps -> Installed apps -> AI Usage Overlay -> Uninstall**, or run **Uninstall AI Usage Overlay** from the Start Menu.

The fallback/manual install can still be removed by running `Uninstall.bat` from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIUsageOverlay` or from a cloned repo.

## Features

- **GitHub release updates** - check for setup EXE updates from the tray and install them in place
- **GSS branding** - Global Shop Solutions identity in the footer

## How It Works

The overlay is a PowerShell/WPF app that reads existing local credentials and usage artifacts:

- Claude live quota comes from Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint using the Claude Code token stored under `~\.claude`.
- Claude local stats are computed from JSONL transcripts under `~\.claude\projects`.
- Codex stats are computed from JSONL sessions under `~\.codex\sessions`.
- Cursor usage is read from Cursor's local auth database and Cursor dashboard APIs.
- Cursor SQLite reads use the bundled `sqlite3.exe`.

No separate credentials are stored by the overlay, and no elevated permissions are required.

## Runtime Files

The app writes a few local state/cache files next to the scripts:

- `unified-overlay-state.json` - window position and UI preferences
- `overlay-history.json` - recent Claude quota samples for alerts and graphing
- `stats-cache.json` - Claude transcript parse cache
- `codex-cache.json` - Codex session parse cache
- `unified-overlay-error.log` - diagnostic log
- `unified-overlay.pid` - running process id used by uninstall/cleanup

These files are local runtime data and are not required in git.

## Development

Developer workflow documentation lives in [docs/developer-procedures.md](docs/developer-procedures.md). Start there for issue writing, branch/PR flow, release tagging, and update verification.

Run the Pester test suite from the repo root:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-Pester -Path tests"
```

Build the installer locally with Inno Setup 6 installed:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File packaging\build-installer.ps1
```

The installer artifact is written to `dist\AIUsageOverlaySetup.exe`. Release builds also publish this artifact from the `Release Installer` GitHub Actions workflow.

The default branch is `master`. The old provider-specific branches have been retired; current development happens against the unified overlay on `master`. Use short-lived feature branches for normal work and merge through pull requests unless a maintainer is intentionally shipping a small release directly.
